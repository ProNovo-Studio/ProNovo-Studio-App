# Purpose

The sdk package contains all of our custom hooks and generated hooks using orval.

# Intended Use

- After creating an api in py-backend, follow the directions in the README in py-backend, and run `npx orval`

- This will create generated hooks in src/py_api.ts, import these hooks into custom_hooks

- Your new hooks are now ready for use in the ui app!
